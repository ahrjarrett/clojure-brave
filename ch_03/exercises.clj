; 1: Use the str, vector, list, hash-map & hash-set fns


; 2: Write a function that takes a number and adds 100 to it


; 3: Write a function, dec-maker, that works exactly like
;    the function inc-maker except with subtraction, like so:
;    (def dec9 (dec-maker 9))
;    (dec9 10)) ; => 1


; 4: Write a function, mapset, that works like map,
;    except the return value is a set


; 5: Create a function thatâ€™s similar to symmetrize-body-parts
;    except that it has to work with weird space aliens with
;    radial symmetry. Instead of two eyes, arms, legs, and so on,
;    they have five


; 6: Create a function that generalizes symmetrize-body-parts
;    and the func- tion you created in Exercise 5. The new function
;    should take a col- lection of body parts and the number of
;    matching body parts to add.
